# dragonburgers

An endless cooking game where you play as a dragon and balance managing your kitchen with dealing with a human infestation!

**Short Postmortem:** I spent most of this semester developing in Unity for classes and projects, so getting back to Godot was really refreshing, and Champlain Montreal's Thanksgiving game jam was a really great opportunity to do so. I worked solo and had a really good time experimenting with Godot's pathfinding meshes and UI hierarchy, systems for generating satisfying but challenging orders, as well as pushing myself to create the best pixel art I could in 48 hours. I'm beyond happy with the final product and I find it as fun to play as it is nice to look at which is a new balance for me that feels really gratifying to finally reach. I've also been working on adding some extras to it in the weeks since I finished it which I'm looking forward to publishing for everyone to play as well.

### Building

This project loads its sound assets dynamically so you need to copy the "sounds" folder next to the executable if you want audio in the build. Hopefully fixing this system at some point, but for now it has to be loaded from disk.
